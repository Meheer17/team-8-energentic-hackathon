# DEG Energy Agentic Platform

A Telegram-based intelligent agent platform for solar onboarding and energy services, built for the DEG Hackathon 2025.

## Overview

This platform provides an AI-powered assistant that helps users with:


## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

### Backend
- Python 3.9+
- python-telegram-bot
- LangChain
- Beckn Protocol API

## Problem Statement

1. **Solar Onboarding (Use Case 1)**: Guides users through the process of getting solar panels installed on their rooftops, including subsidy discovery, installer matching, and ROI calculation.

2. **Energy Services (Use Case 2)**: Helps users with installed solar systems to participate in energy markets, sell excess energy, earn through demand response, and tokenize their energy as NFTs.

## Features

### Solar Onboarding Agent
- Rooftop image analysis for solar potential
- Address-based subsidy and incentive discovery
- Solar installer matching and recommendations
- ROI calculation and financial projections
- Simplified paperwork and documentation assistance

### Prosumer Energy Agent
- Energy production monitoring and visualization
- Energy trading opportunities discovery
- Demand response program participation
- NFT tokenization of energy credits
- AI-powered automatic energy trading
