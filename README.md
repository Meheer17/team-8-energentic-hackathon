## 📚 Challenges & Learnings

## 📚 Challenges & Learnings

Throughout this hackathon, we encountered several challenges:

- Integrating multiple AI services (GPT, Vertex AI, LangChain) into a cohesive workflow
- Building a responsive Telegram bot interface that handles various media types
- Implementing the Beckn Protocol for energy services discovery
- Managing authentication and security across multiple APIs
- Optimizing performance for real-time image analysis

Key learnings:

- The importance of modular architecture in complex AI systems
- Effective prompt engineering for specialized energy domain knowledge
- Leveraging blockchain for transparent energy trading mechanisms
- Because documentation was awesome, it took us no time to just focus our minds on solving the real challenges
- The value of user-centric design even in technical B2B applications
